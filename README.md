This project pulls together many other projects based around building a game engine on java3d and JBullet that imports the assets of the Bethesda games built on teh Gamebryo engine.

I need these assets as place holders for another game project (not open source)

This particular project is used as a test bed but also proves the following:

The BSA, nif and esm file loaders are working

The Java3d scene graphs created from tehm are workign

The JBullet physics simualtion from tehm is working
